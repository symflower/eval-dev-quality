This evaluation ran over several days and is actually assembled from several sub-evaluations. Hence, we only provide the `csv` results for now because the logs are distributed all over.

The benchmark consisted of `5x` runs, **except** for the `code-repair` task, which contains only one usable run because of [a bug that is already fixed for later versions](https://github.com/symflower/eval-dev-quality/commit/19011da21c3196e346d363148bf83989dc1f2a88).
