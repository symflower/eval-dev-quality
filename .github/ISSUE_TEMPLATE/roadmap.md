Release version of this roadmap issue:

> ‚ùì When should a release happen? Check the [`README`](../../README.md#when-and-how-to-release)!

- [ ] Do a full evaluation with the version
  - [ ] Exclude certain Openrouter models by default
    - [ ] `nitro` cause they are just faster

    - [ ] `free` and `auto` cause these are just "aliases" for existing models
  - [ ] Exclude special-purpose models
    - [ ] Vision models
    - [ ] Roleplay and creative writing models
    - [ ] Classification models
    - [ ] Models with internet access (usually denoted by `-online` suffix)
    - [ ] Models with extended context windows (usually denoted by `-1234K` suffix)
  - [ ] Always prefer fine tuned (`-instruct`, `-chat`) models over a plain base model
- [ ] Tag version (tag can be moved in case important merges happen afterwards)
- [ ] For all issues of the current milestone, one by one, add them to the roadmap tasks (it is ok if a task has multiple issues) with the users that worked on it
  - Fixed bugs should always be sorted into respective relevant categories and not in a generic "Bugs" category!
